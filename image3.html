        Dagdusheth and a close friend of him. He had the idea of celebrating Ganesh festival at the temple and then
        onwards, it became an epoch-making event. The beautiful temple has Jay and Vijay, the two sentinels made of
        marble attracts the millions of hearts coming to visit the temple. The temple was constructed very simply so
        that the idol of Ganesha can be seen from outside. The idol is huge with 7.5 feet height and 4 feet width.
