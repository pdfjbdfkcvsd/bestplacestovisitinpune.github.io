    <div class="textdesign">Lal Mahal is one of the famous tourist places in Pune which has another name as Red Palace. It is a beautiful
        monument established in 1630 AD by Shivaji Maharaj’s father Shahaji Bhosale for his wife and son. Shivaji
        Maharaj lived here for a long time until the time he captured his first fort.

        The original one had undergone several destructions and the current one is a reconstructed structure,
        located at the heart of the city. Shivaji’s wedding with Maharani Saibai took place in this palace.

        The original monument was constructed with the aim of rejuvenating the city of Pune when Dadoji Kondev
        entered the city with Shivaji Maharaj. The history recorded at various places proves the fact that Lal Mahal
        was used for organising feasts for the Brahmins during the thread ceremony of Sadoba, the son of
        Chimajiappa.

        The original location where the monument was first established is still unknown, perhaps it was known to be
        located very close to the location of Shaniwarwada. The newly constructed Lal Mahal does not have many
        features the old one possessed and it is not built in the same fashion as well.

        Pune Municipal Corporation was the one who rebuilt the current Lal Mahal and the construction was begun in
        1984 and ended in 1988. The Lal Mahal became an important part of the history after an encounter between
        Shivaji and Shaista Khan when the former cut off the latter’s fingers and he tried to escape from the window
        of the Lal Mahal. The current palace displays a collection of large sized oil paintings based on the
        important events happened in the life of Shivaji. There is the Jijamata Garden now recognised as a
        recreational park for kids.<br>
