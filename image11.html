    <div class="textdesign">Khadakwasla Dam is one of the primary visiting places in Pune located at Khadakwasla, the location where the NDA is. The dam is built on the Mutha River, situated about 20 kilometres from Pune city. The dam has created a beautiful lake known as Khadkawasla Lake. The lake is the main source of water for the city and its suburbs. 

        The largest lake in the region is Mushi Lake which is located about 50 kilometres away from Khadakwasla. Near the dam, there is the famous National Defence Academy, the Institute of Advanced Technology. Also, there is the popular Sinhagad Fort and the twin dams of Panshet and Varasgaon which supply water for irrigation.
        
        The Khadakwasla Dam was burst in 1961 and that was the greatest ever natural disaster that affected Pune for a while. But it was not blown up but collapsed at the point of greatest impulsive force. The dam is measured to be 1.6 kilometres long and the river on which the dam is built begins from the confluence of the two rivers, Ambi and Mose. The backwaters of the Khadakwasla is around 22 kilometres and it is widened up to 250 to 1000 meters.
        
        The dam possesses 11 radial sluice gates and six irrigation outlets and they flow into two canals. The birth of this dam and the lake is a great history. The man-made lake was built by Captain Fife RE of the British Army who had recommended a high-level reservoir at Khadakwasla in 1863. Thus, the lake has another name as well that is Lake Fife. Famous for one of the most viewed Pune tourist places, this area is beautified with natural serenity and people come to visit the dam for a leisurely, peaceful time. The Sinhagad Fort located near is also one of the best Pune places to visit as it is suitable for cycling.<br>
