At the end of the World War II, the then Commander in Chief of the Indian Army, Field Marshal Claude Auchinleck, after witnessing the experiences of the army during the war formed a committee to study various military academies in the world and submitted a report to the Government of India in 1946. 
            
            That committee came up with the idea of the establishment of a Joint Services Military Academy. After India got independent, the Chiefs of Staff Committee implemented the recommendations of the Auchinleck report and afterwards, the committee initiated a plan in late 1947 to establish a permanent defence academy. The foundation stone for the construction of the academy was laid in 1949 by the then Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru.
