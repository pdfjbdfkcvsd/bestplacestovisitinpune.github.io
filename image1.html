        <div class="textdesign">A prominent historical landmark in Pune is Shaniwarwada which is considered as one of the best pune tourist
            places. It is a majestic fortification which was built in 1732 and during that time it was the seat of the
            Peshwas of the Maratha Empire and they ruled over there until 1818. After they lost control to the British
            East India Company, they could not use it longer. But when they were in the reign, Shaniwarwada was the
            centre of Indian politics in the 18th century and is one of the famous places to visit in pune with friends.

            But in 1828, the fort was destroyed by a huge fire and later the remnants were transformed to become a
            tourist site. Shaniwarwada was a seven-storied capital building of the Peshwas and they wanted the building
            to be made of stone alone. However, after the completion of the ground floor, the people of Satara insisted
            that stone monument can be sanctioned and built only by the Shahu King, not the Peshwas.

            With respect to it, the Peshwas were asked to continue the construction of the building by using only
            bricks. But when the British attacked, only the base floor survived while all the other floors were
            completely destroyed. Earlier, the fort used to accommodate around thousand people. The major buildings
            inside the fort are Thora Rayancha Diwankhana or the court reception hall of the eldest royal member,
            Naachacha Diwankhana which is the dance hall, Juna Arsa Mahal that is the Old Mirror Hall and so on. Since
            all the buildings were destroyed in the fire, only descriptions of the remaining areas are available
            currently.

            The doorways were made of teak arches with ornamental teardrop teak pillars shaped like Suru trunks.
            Ceilings were beautified by numerous chandeliers and the floors were filled with polished marble adorned
            with rich Persian rugs. The walls displayed paintings depicting the Hindu epics. The top floor of the
            building enacted as the residence of the Peshwa and it was called Meghadambari. Among many Pune places to
            visit, this palace has it's own value and is a must visit location.<br>
