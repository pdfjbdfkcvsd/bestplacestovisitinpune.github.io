    <div class="textdesign">A prominent hill in the city limits of Pune is Vetal Hill which is the highest point at an elevation of 2600
        feet and one of the unforgettable places to see in Pune. Vetala temple is also located on the top of the
        hill and that is how the hill got its name as Vetal Hill. Adventure seekers come here in plenty to escape

        places to visit in Pune.

        Near the temple, there is an observation desk set up by the Indian Forest Department. Vetal Tekdi is the
        Marathi name and from the hilltop, one can watch the Pune city as a whole on a clear day. The hill is a part
        of Bhamburda Van Vihar on the western side of Pune Municipal Corporation and an important part of Pune
        Tourism.

        Vetal Tekdi has two spurs named Fergusson College Hill and Chatturshrungi Hill. There is one access road
        that takes people up the hill from the south. Also, a public parking lot is located along the road but the
        access to it is restricted to between 08:30 am and 05:30 pm. The area has been undergoing some anthropogenic
        activities for last some years- plantation of many exotic species, urban development, deforestation etc are
        a few of the activities that make the hill important.

        Currently, Vetal Hill is an area protected by the India Forestry Department and the State Forest Department
