        <div class="textdesign">This beautiful lush green hill is one of the prominent Pune visiting places. Not only is the place popular for trekking and escaping into nature, but is famous for its ancient Paravati Temple atop the summit. This temple, located at around 2,100 ft. above sea level, was built during the time of the Peshwas and it is one of the best places in Pune.

        One of the best activities in Pune is to see the sunset from this hilltop, which is reachable after a climb of around 103 steps. There are also other temples like Devdeveshwar temple, Kartikeya temple, and Vishnu temple at the top. Donâ€™t miss the Peshwa Museum to see pictures and exhibits about the glorious life of Peshwa rulers.<br>
