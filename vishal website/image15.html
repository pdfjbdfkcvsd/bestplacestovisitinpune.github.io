        Tucked away from the bustling city, lies a surreal place in Pune, Pune Okayama Friendship Garden that looks refreshingly green everywhere around as far as your eyes can see! Spread across 10 acres of land, This garden is inspired by a 300-year-old Japanese Korakuen garden that was developed by Ikeda Royal family in Okayama, Japan. 

This is the biggest Japanese garden in the world outside Japan and has also been featured in many Bollywood movies. The garden has become a key attraction in Pune and is also referred to as Pu. La. Deshpande Garden, in fond memory of Pu. La. Deshpande, a renowned Marathi writer.

The Japanese believe that "to have something, there also has to be nothing". This Yin and Yang philosophy of having light and darkness, stillness and motion, soft and hard, warm and cold is depicted in the garden through the composition of natural elements like fire, harmony, line, spirit, world, and water. The Japanese consider gardens as spiritual places to meditate and seek one’s inner self and the Pune Okayama Garden stands perfectly in line with this ideology. 

The verdant lawns and the soothing ambience revitalizes one’s senses and kindles their spiritual call. One can experience unexplained happiness and contentment just as they step into the garden! 

The garden has beautiful natural landscapes and man-made add-ons that make it look so spectacular. The canal running through the garden is filled with colourful fish and the moon bridge over the canal is a great location to spot the bright orange coloured fish swimming around. 

The attractions within the garden include a waterfall, a pond, lanterns, artificial hillocks, and a forest. The landscape of the garden is diverse and as one walks through the serene pathways listening to the rumbling sound of the stream and the chirping of the birds, one can witness the change in the garden landscape. There are Pergolas around this huge garden, where one can sit, relax, and enjoy the tranquillity engulfing this place. 

The park is maintained extremely well and visitors are not allowed to picnic or stroll through the lawn. The tall, thick trees and the numerous varieties of flowering plants at Pune Okayama Garden are undeniably an exhilarating respite to the sore eyes!
