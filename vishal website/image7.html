    <div class="textdesign">Sinhagad or Kondana is a pride of the southwestern region of Pune. This fort was the one to support
        Maharashtra during the ancient battles. Sinhagad battle of 1671 is the significant one. Bhuleshwar range of
        the great Sahyadris is the home to this historical monument. The fortress has an elevation of around 1312 m
        above the sea level. Sinhagad has got its own breakneck slopes to protect it from all sides.

        There are two entrances to this fort – one in the north-eastern region (Pune Darwaza) and another one
        towards the southeastern part (Kalyan Darwaza). The authenticity and the richness of Sinhagad fortress date
        back to around 1000 years. This is evident from the carvings present on the walls of Kaundinya Eshwar temple
        there. Sinhagad is valued as a true sightseeing heritage.

        To begin your sightseeing adventure, you have Rajaram’s tomb which is worth a visit. The fortress displays
        some of the adorable monoliths of Tanaji Malusare – one of the efficient safe-keepers of the fort from
        Shivaji Maharaj’s era. Besides these crucial displays, the fortress has got its own military depot, a Kali
        temple, breweries, and a Hanuman effigy.

        Pune Darwaza, Kalyan Darwaza, Tilak Bungalow, Hawa Point, Kade Lot, Amruteshwar Temple, Tanaji Samadhi and
        Memorial raises the elegance of this fortress even today.

        Summiting the fortress offers some stunning views of the Khadakwasla Dam from one end; while from its other
        side, you can see glimpses of Torna Fort.</div></body>
